“Touch-sensitive fabric with handmade embroidery triggering sound output using conductive thread”
# Interactive Fabric Design using Conductive Thread

This project creatively integrates **traditional embroidery** with **modern embedded systems** to build a touch-sensitive textile surface that plays sound on touch using **conductive thread** and a **DFPlayer MP3 module** controlled by an **ESP32 microcontroller**.

## 🧵 Project Overview

We designed a bird-shaped fabric pattern using **handmade embroidery and Khatli work** on cotton fabric. Conductive thread is stitched into the design to act as a **capacitive touch sensor**. When touched, the ESP32 detects it and triggers audio output via the DFPlayer Mini module connected to a speaker.

This project is a fusion of:
- **Art + Technology**
- **Traditional textile design + Modern interaction**

---

## 🎯 Objective

To create an interactive textile-based system that showcases the potential of **smart fabrics**, **IoT**, and **wearable electronics** using local craft and digital technology.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

- **ESP32**: Microcontroller for sensor reading and controlling MP3 module.
- **DFPlayer Mini MP3 Module**: Plays preloaded audio files via microSD.
- **Conductive Thread**: Acts as a touch sensor when sewn onto the fabric.
- **Arduino IDE**: Software for code development.
- **Prezi**: Used to present project flow and design.
- **Handmade Embroidery + Khatli Work**: To design the interactive pattern.

## 📌 Features

- Touch the embroidered bird → Plays bird sound.
- Portable and fabric-safe circuit using zero PCB.
- Handmade 3D model and design aesthetics.

---

## 🔄 Future Scope

- Expand to full garments with multiple touch triggers.
- Add Bluetooth/wireless sound output.
- Integrate with gesture or motion detection.
